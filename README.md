# Welcome to my first real *"big"* project which is not that big but i'm a little proud of it

*Converso is a chat application where you can chat with your friends on a same room*

![Home Page](https://github.com/LoicMuller/Chat-App/blob/master/chat-app/src/Img/homeBackgroundForGH.PNG)

### Getting started

- First, you need to create an account
- Then, log in into it
- When logged in, you will be redirected to the "Join" page
- Here, you will have to enter a name of the room where you wanna go
- When you did it, you will access this room with the username you entered in the registration page

**But the problem is that you are alone here, so give [this link](https://converso.netlify.app) to one or more of your friends**

- After that, you can ask your friends to join the same room than you
- Then you can chat with 'em without any problem

**If you wanna go back and join another room**

- Click the cross at the top right of the discussion box
- **Some bugs can appear when your click the cross, due to netlify deploy**
- Type another room name, invite your friends and so on... keep chatting with your friends
